# Devo Deployar?

## Overview

Devo Deployar? is a website built using Next.js that provides a fun and lighthearted way to help users decide whether or not they should deploy their code. Inspired by the popular website [shouldideploy.today](https://shouldideploy.today/), Devo Deployar? takes a similar approach to helping developers make the right decision.

The site features a simple interface with a prominent "Click here" button and a series of humorous phrases that change depending on the user's input. If the user clicks the "Click here" button or hit the "Enter" key, the site will generate a random phrase that either encourages or discourages deployment.

## Technologies Used

Devo Deployar? is built using Next.js, a popular React-based framework for building server-side rendered web applications. The site also uses CSS modules for styling and is deployed on Vercel.
